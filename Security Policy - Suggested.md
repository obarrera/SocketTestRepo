| Bin Script Shell Injection   | This package re-exports a well-known shell command via an npm bin script. This is possibly a supply chain risk.                                                                                            | Supply chain risk | High     |
| HTTP dependency              | Contains a dependency which resolves to a remote HTTP URL which could be used to inject untrusted code and reduce overall package reliability.                                                             | Supply chain risk | Critical |
| Git dependency               | Contains a dependency which resolves to a GitHub URL. Dependencies fetched from GitHub specifiers are not immutable and can be used to inject untrusted code or reduce the likelihood of a reproducible install. | Supply chain risk | Critical |
| Telemetry                    | This package contains telemetry which tracks how it is used.                                                                                                                                               | Supply chain risk | High     |
