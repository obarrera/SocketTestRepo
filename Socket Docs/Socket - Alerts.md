2. **AI Detected Potential Malware**
   - **Action**: Treat with high suspicion. Block the package temporarily.
   - **Follow-up**: Conduct a manual code review. Discuss with the security team to confirm and decide on further actions.

3. **Critical CVE**
   - **Action**: Assess the impact on the system. Patch or update the package immediately.
   - **Follow-up**: Perform a security audit to ensure no breaches have occurred. Communicate updates to the team.

4. **Potential Typo Squat**
   - **Action**: Verify the package name and compare it with the popular packages it mimics.
   - **Follow-up**: Remove and replace the package if confirmed as a typo squat. Notify the team to prevent future occurrences.

#### Medium Priority Alerts (Prompt Attention Required)

1. **Protestware or Potentially Unwanted Behavior**
   - **Action**: Examine the package functionality.
   - **Follow-up**: Replace the package if the behavior is confirmed. Inform the team and update documentation.

2. **Unstable Ownership**
   - **Action**: Monitor the package for any unusual updates.
   - **Follow-up**: Consider finding alternative packages. Notify the team of potential risks.

3. **New Author**
   - **Action**: Keep an eye on updates from the new author.
   - **Follow-up**: Perform periodic reviews of the package. Notify the team of the new author for awareness.

4. **AI Detected Security Risk**
   - **Action**: Perform a thorough security review of the package.
   - **Follow-up**: Fix vulnerabilities if found or replace the package. Alert the team and provide details of the findings and actions taken.

5. **HTTP Dependency / Git Dependency**
   - **Action**: Review the dependency to ensure its integrity.
   - **Follow-up**: Consider fetching dependencies from more reliable sources or pinning specific versions. Update the team on the changes and ensure all dependencies are checked for similar issues.

#### Low Priority Alerts (Monitor and Review)

1. **Non-existent Author**
   - **Action**: Investigate the reason for the non-existent author.
   - **Follow-up**: If the package is otherwise secure, monitor its usage. Document the investigation results.

2. **Unpopular Package**
   - **Action**: Assess the necessity of the package.
   - **Follow-up**: Consider replacing it with a more popular and well-maintained package.

3. **Deprecated**
   - **Action**: Plan to replace the package with a maintained alternative.
   - **Follow-up**: Update documentation and inform the team.

4. **Minified Code**
   - **Action**: Review the original source if possible.
   - **Follow-up**: Ensure minified code doesn’t contain malicious elements.

5. **Floating Dependency**
   - **Action**: Pin dependencies to specific versions.
   - **Follow-up**: Monitor for updates and changes in dependencies.

6. **Telemetry**
   - **Action**: Review the data being tracked.
   - **Follow-up**: Ensure compliance with privacy policies and regulations. Notify the team and stakeholders about the telemetry.

#### Technical Alerts (Code Review and Validation)

1. **Obfuscated Code**
   - **Action**: Perform a detailed code review.
   - **Follow-up**: Replace the package if necessary. Maintain a log of such incidents for future reference.

2. **Dynamic Require / Uses Eval**
   - **Action**: Evaluate the necessity and safety of dynamic code execution.
   - **Follow-up**: Refactor the code to remove or replace such practices where possible.

3. **Filesystem/Network/Shell Access**
   - **Action**: Assess the security impact of these accesses.
   - **Follow-up**: Ensure proper sandboxing and isolation. Monitor for any unusual activity involving these accesses.

4. **Install Scripts**
   - **Action**: Audit install scripts for malicious behavior.
   - **Follow-up**: Replace packages with suspicious install scripts if necessary.

5. **High Entropy Strings**
   - **Action**: Investigate the high entropy strings to determine if they are encrypted data, leaked secrets, or obfuscated code.
   - **Follow-up**: If necessary, refactor the code to remove or replace these strings.

6. **Network Access**
   - **Action**: Review the module’s network access.
   - **Follow-up**: Ensure that the network access is necessary and secure. Implement measures to monitor network activity.

#### Maintenance and Monitoring

1. **Unmaintained**
   - **Action**: Look for alternative packages.
   - **Follow-up**: Schedule periodic reviews to ensure ongoing compatibility and security.

2. **Deprecated License**
   - **Action**: Plan to replace the package with one that has a current license.
   - **Follow-up**: Ensure all legal requirements are met and update the team on the status.

3. **Ambiguous License Classifier**
   - **Action**: Review the license classifier to understand the legal implications.
   - **Follow-up**: Consult with the legal team if necessary and document the findings.

4. **Non-permissive License / Legal Notice**
   - **Action**: Consult with the legal team to understand implications.
   - **Follow-up**: Assess the risk of continuing to use the package. Document any legal concerns and inform stakeholders.

### Legal and Licensing Alerts

1. **Explicitly Unlicensed Item**
   - **Action**: Review the package for any licensing issues.
   - **Follow-up**: Consult with the legal team if necessary and document the findings.

2. **Copyleft License**
   - **Action**: Understand the implications of using a copyleft license.
   - **Follow-up**: Ensure compliance with the license terms and document any requirements.

3. **Non-OSI License**
