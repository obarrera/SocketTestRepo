## How to Guide: Using Socket with a SIEM Tool like Elastic (ELK Stack)

### Introduction

Integrating Socket with a SIEM tool like Elastic (ELK Stack) allows you to centralize and correlate security data, enhancing your ability to monitor, detect, and respond to security threats in real-time. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up Socket to work with Elastic.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A Socket account with API access.
- Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) installed and configured.
- Administrator permissions to configure integrations and manage environment variables.
- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

### Step 1: Setting Up Socket

**1.1 Sign Up and Log In**
- Visit the [Socket website](https://docs.socket.dev/docs/getting-started) and sign up for an account.
- Log in to your account to access the Socket dashboard.

**1.2 Install Socket CLI**
- Open your terminal and run the following command to install the Socket CLI globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @socketsecurity/cli
  ```

### Step 2: Installing the Socket SIEM Connector

**2.1 Clone the Repository**
- Clone the SIEM connector repository from GitHub:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-siem-connector.git
  cd socket-siem-connector
  ```

**2.2 Install Dependencies**
- Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

### Step 3: Configuring the Socket SIEM Connector

**3.1 Set Environment Variables**
- Configure the necessary environment variables to integrate Socket with Elastic. Open your terminal and set the following variables:
  ```bash
  export SOCKET_API_KEY=your_socket_api_key
  export ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200
  export ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME=your_elastic_username
  export ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=your_elastic_password
  ```

**3.2 Update the Configuration File**
- Open the `config.js` file in the `socket-siem-connector` directory and update the configuration with your Elastic and Socket details:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    socket: {
      apiKey: process.env.SOCKET_API_KEY,
    },
    elasticsearch: {
      url: process.env.ELASTICSEARCH_URL,
      username: process.env.ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME,
      password: process.env.ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD,
    },
  };
  ```

### Step 4: Running the Socket SIEM Connector

**4.1 Start the Connector**
- Run the SIEM connector to start sending data from Socket to Elastic:
  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```

**4.2 Verify Data Ingestion**
- Open Kibana and navigate to **Discover**.
- Use the following query to verify that data is being ingested from Socket:
  ```kql
  index="socket-*"
  ```

### Step 5: Creating Dashboards and Alerts in Kibana

**5.1 Create a Dashboard**
- Navigate to **Dashboards** in Kibana.
- Click on **Create New Dashboard** and configure it to display Socket security data.

**5.2 Add Panels to the Dashboard**
- Add new panels to visualize different aspects of the data, such as alerts, vulnerabilities, and security events.
- Use Kibana’s visualization tools to create charts, graphs, and tables based on the Socket data.

**5.3 Configure Alerts**
- Set up real-time alerts in Kibana to notify you of critical security events from Socket.
- Navigate to **Alerting**.
- Create a new alert and configure the conditions based on the Socket data.

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the dashboards and alerts in Kibana to stay informed about potential security issues.
2. **Data Correlation**: Correlate Socket data with other security data sources in Elastic to gain a comprehensive view of your security posture.
3. **Automated Responses**: Configure automated responses to critical alerts using Kibana’s alert actions to quickly mitigate potential threats.
4. **Data Retention**: Ensure your Elastic data retention policies are configured to retain Socket data for the necessary period for compliance and analysis.
5. **Security Reviews**: Regularly review and update your Socket and Elastic configurations to adapt to new security challenges and requirements.

### Troubleshooting

- **No Data in Kibana**: Ensure that the environment variables are correctly set and that the Socket SIEM connector is running without errors.
- **Authentication Issues**: Verify that the Elastic username and password are correct and have the necessary permissions.
- **Data Format Issues**: Check the data format being sent from Socket to Elastic and ensure it matches the expected format for your Elastic setup.

By following this guide, you can effectively integrate Socket with Elastic, enhancing your ability to monitor and respond to security threats in your software development lifecycle.
