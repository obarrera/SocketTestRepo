| Alert                          | Alert Info                                                                                             | Category          | Severity |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Known malware                  | This package is malware. We have asked the package registry to remove it.                              | Supply chain risk | Critical |
| Protestware or potentially unwanted behavior | This package is a joke, parody, or includes undocumented or hidden behavior unrelated to its primary function. | Supply chain risk | High     |
| AI detected potential malware  | AI has identified this package as malware. This is a strong signal that the package may be malicious.  | Supply chain risk | High     |
| Potential Typo Squat           | Package name is similar to other popular packages and may not be the package you want.                | Supply chain risk | Critical |
| Obfuscated code                | Obfuscated files are intentionally packed to hide their behavior. This could be a sign of malware.    | Supply chain risk | High     |
| Shell access                   | This module accesses the system shell. Accessing the system shell increases the risk of executing arbitrary code. | Supply chain risk | Critical |
| Network access                 | This module accesses the network.                                                                     | Supply chain risk | High     |
| Native code                    | Contains native code which could be a vector to obscure malicious code, and generally decrease the likelihood of reproducible or reliable installs. | Supply chain risk | High     |

|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Bin Script Shell Injection   | This package re-exports a well-known shell command via an npm bin script. This is possibly a supply chain risk.                                                                                            | Supply chain risk | High     |
| HTTP dependency              | Contains a dependency which resolves to a remote HTTP URL which could be used to inject untrusted code and reduce overall package reliability.                                                             | Supply chain risk | Critical |
| Git dependency               | Contains a dependency which resolves to a GitHub URL. Dependencies fetched from GitHub specifiers are not immutable and can be used to inject untrusted code or reduce the likelihood of a reproducible install. | Supply chain risk | Critical |
| Telemetry                    | This package contains telemetry which tracks how it is used.                                                                                                                                               | Supply chain risk | High     |
| AI detected security risk    | AI has determined that this package may contain potential security issues or vulnerabilities.                                                                                                              | Supply chain risk | High     |
| High entropy strings         | Contains high entropy strings. This could be a sign of encrypted data, leaked secrets, or obfuscated code.                                                                                                  | Supply chain risk | Medium   |
| New author                   | A new npm collaborator published a version of the package for the first time. New collaborators are usually benign additions to a project, but do indicate a change to the security surface area of a package. | Supply chain risk | Medium   |
| Unstable ownership           | A new collaborator has begun publishing package versions. Package stability and security risk may be elevated.                                                                                             | Supply chain risk | Medium   |
